# Python_for_Data_Science: ETEC June 2021 course

# Overview
This training will introduce participants to Python, the most widely-used programming language for data science. In the course of the three-day training, we will cover a number of topics through a combination of lectures and hands-on exercises. The instructors are Nick Jones (GFDRR Labs) and Dharana Rijal (DECAT).

__Objectives__: (i) improve the Python skills of ETEC staff; (ii) enable participants to load, clean and analyze datasets (including prepare data for visualization on dashboards).


__Format__: Training sessions will comprise of: (i) interactive lecture sessions; (ii) lab sessions where participants write code on their own laptops. Materials are delivered via Google Colab (a cloud-based platform accessed through participants’ web browsers).

__Participant outcomes__: With no coding knowledge before the course, participants should be able to access and combine a diverse set of datasets, conduct data exploration and visualization, utilize Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning, and be able to teach themselves next steps.

# Running the scripts
Two methods:
* _Beginner method:_ Click the links to 'open notebook in Colab.' (need to log in to Google account; no software installation required)
* _Preferred method:_ Install Anaconda Navigator in the folder C:\WBG from the software catalogue on eServices. Download the scripts (or clone the repository with Git) and load the notebooks (.ipynb files) in Jupyter Notebooks on your laptop.
